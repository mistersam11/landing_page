# Landing Page
## Landing page project for The Odin Project
### Method
I began by creating the file structure using only shell commands for practice. After creating the 'index.html' and 'style.css' files using the 'touch' command, I created the page structure in 'index', thinking through how each item in each section would need to be laid out using flex.

After each section's html was in place, I worked on the css for that section, until it was in a place that I liked. I moved through all the sections in this way until finally the page looked pretty close to the reference image.
